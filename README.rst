DropSFTP
########


This is a demo project for a talk I gave several years ago at a local Python
User Group. The project shows how to implement an SFTP with the Python library 
paramiko_ and how to use the MacFSEvents_ framework to upload files, which are
added to a specific local folder, to a remote SFTP server automatically.
